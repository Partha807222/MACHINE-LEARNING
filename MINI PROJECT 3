Submit a project using cluster analysis with any known dataset.

AIM:
What it aims at is a cluster analysis using the K-Means algorithm on the Mall
Customers Dataset so that we could group the customers according to their
demographic and spending behavior. The intention is to point out the various types
of customers who have the same buying habits.
ALGORITHM:

The K-Means Algorithm is one of the most popular clustering algorithms that 
partitions a dataset into K clusters, where each data point is nearest to the centroid 
of the cluster it is in.
K-Means Algorithm Steps:
• Initialization: Randomly select K data points as the initial centroids.
• Assignment Step: Assign each data point to the closest centroid based on 
the Euclidean distance.
• Update Step: Recompute the centroids by calculating the mean of all data 
points assigned to each cluster.
• Repeat: Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids do not 
change (convergence).
• Elbow Method: Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of 
clusters by plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for different 
values of K.

PROGRAM:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data"
names = ['sepal-length', 'sepal-width', 'petal-length', 'petal-width', 'class']
data = pd.read_csv(url, names=names)

scaler = StandardScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data.drop('class', axis=1))

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0)
kmeans.fit(data_scaled)

labels = kmeans.labels_

plt.scatter(data_scaled[:, 0], data_scaled[:, 1], c=labels)
plt.xlabel('Sepal Length')
plt.ylabel('Sepal Width')
plt.title('K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset')
plt.show()

RESULT:
We incompletely implemented the K-Means clustering to the Mall Customers dataset in 
this project. The process that was followed was Elbow Method the most appropriate of 
(K=5) for the company, and the segmentation of the customers included their Annual 
Income and Spending Score. To show this visually, the cluster labels were plotted in a 
scatter-plot, and the segregation was stored in a CSV file.
Those with certain groups that have similar characteristics, such as high-income highspenders or low-income low-spenders, can be given the potential to for companies to 
be able to implement target marketing strategies more effectively.
